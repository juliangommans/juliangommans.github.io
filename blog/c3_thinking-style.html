    <div id="content">Phase 0 of EDA has been a rollercoaster for me, in difficulty, stress levels, fun and learning. I have enjoyed it overall and think that regardless of what I've learned, technically, that I've grown as an individual, know more about myself, how to manage my time and my idividual learning style.

    My biggest struggles from this course have come from getting too bogged down in trying to find a solution. I tend to find that I want to know exactly where I went wrong, and all of the possible outcomes so that I know it through and through and can avoid making the same mistakes in the future. Unfortunately this does become a big time sink and as it is very busy (being nearly Christmas) and I am still working full time I needed to pay closer attention to the amount of time I spent doing specific things.

    I have learned through doing this course that one of the key things I need to do to improve my learning and work practices is to take regular breaks. I tended to find myself beating my head against a wall attacking the same problem repeatedly that I could, to quote someone wiser than me "see the forest for the trees". This came to a head particularly when I was struggling to get CSS to work how I wanted it too in week 2 and I ended up spending 4-5 hours on one section of one challenge getting no where. Now I have a self imposed limit of 25 minutes of working before I need to stop, stand up, get a drink or something to eat or talk to someone or play with the dog etc. and then come back 5-10 minutes later. I tend to solve most of my problems within the next 5 minutes of comming back.

    This makes sense when I apply my situation to my "Gregorc Thinking Style" which is a combination of "Concrete Random" and "Abstract Sequential". Living in a world of abstract thought and theories as well as being an experimenter leads me to spend a lot of time thinking (often too deeply) about a problem while trying lots of different routes to see what works (and what doesn). The problems with this are evident above in that it causes me to get bogged down in a problem too often, and the best solution is to take a step back, and look at it with fresh eyes after a breif pause.

    So far I think it has worked wonders as I have had a much more relaxed and enjoyable experience in week-3. It took a lot less time and I didn't have any stressful episodes. I will be applying the same strategy to the upcoming weeks and hoepfully it will be just as successful.

    Thanks for reading my Blog
