    <div id="content"><p>Exploring your values</p>
        <p>In general I like to live up to the following values (out of 5):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accountability - 3</li>
        <li>Compassion - 5</li>
        <li>Creativity - 4</li>
        <li>Honesty - 5</li>
        <li>Introspection - 4</li>
        <li>Fairness - 5</li>
        <li>Justice - 5</li>
        <li>Privacy - 4</li>
        <li>Efficiency - 4</li>
        <li>Freedom - 5</li>
        <li>Independence - 4</li>
        <li>Insight - 4</li>
      </ul>
          <p> I find that fairness is a very important value that I strive to maintain in my life. Everyone wants to have a fair deal and there are still a lot of people in the world who don't get theirs. I try my hardest to be as fair as possible and be understanding/include as many people as possible.</p>
          <p> I feel happy and like I can still improve when I look at my values. I don't really suffer from a lot of Stereotype threat so I'm not overly concerned. I think I could do with going for a walk when I'm feeling down or overwhelemed while on-site. My main concern is getting stuck in a "rabbit hole", but with regular breaks for coffee, a chat and/or a walk I think it should be managable.</p>
