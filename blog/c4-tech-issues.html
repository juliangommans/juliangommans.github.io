    <div id="content">Burnout is a problem in the tech world as employees spend a lot of time sedintary staring at an artifically lit screen going over and over the same code.

      As the public (and sometimes employers) are less and less patient for new/original/exciting content the pressures in the tech world on its employees is ever growing. Budgets are tighter, hours are longer and computing power/devices are more complex. Due to such issues employee burnout is a great concern facing the technology industry.

      Many incredibly successful tech companies like google and facebook are well aware of this fact and it is why the public often associate their workplaces as playgrounds. Having lots of time to disengage from the rabbit hole that can be getting your code to work just right. Sometimes doing nothing can be the most productive thing you can do. I have recently found out myself that persisting at chasing the rabbit leads to unproductive time making the same mistakes, and sometimes taking a break and coming back allows you to see it in a new light and solve the problem.

      The average tech employer could do with taking a leaf out of the big boys books and allowing more free time for it's employees to relax and restart their mind. A game of pool/table tennis or a trip to a nearby cafe can be all it takes to get your head out of a rut and give you a new angle to view your code from. the 5-10 minute break might save you half an hour to an hours time.

      I hope this has been informative

      Thanks for reading
