Beginnings of git usage.

Why use gits?

Git is a great resource for tracking, well, almost anything but especially code. Git is a local program that uses a system called "version control" which you can think of like having save points in a video game. Any time you commit a change to the original file it is saved in gits version control. This is mostly useful in coding because if you change some code and it completely breaks your program, you can revert back to an earlier version and try again (or at least look for where the program breaking bug occured)

Github is like an online verison of git, it is mostly opensource meaning that it is a great tool for groups working on a project to use. Anyone can make and commit changes with the right permissions and when you can see exactly what they did. If you don't like it or, again, if it breaks, you can revert to the version before that particular edit. It allows people to work from different offices, countries, or even from home while providing safety from a complete dismembering of your code.

Thats all for now
