    <div id="content"><p>What is Stereotype Threat? Well it was "discovered" by social Psychologist Dr. Claude Steel when he wanted to find out why black students at university had a higher dropout rate and lower overall score while having the same skills and abilities as their white counterparts. His study revealed that simply being told what race you were or even asked would change your mindset/outlook. This is important because when not mentioning race at all there was a dramatic increase in performance by those individuals. It is called Stereotype Threat because you are over anxious to avoid fulfilling negative stereotype roles and it clouds your clarity of mind/judgement.</p>
      <p> Have I ever experienced Stereotype Threat? Well I don't personally belong to many groups that might be considered a minority, as a white middle class male I guess I am about as par for the course as they come. The closest i'd say is just in day to day life. I might worry people would think I'm a racist if I stare at someone of a different race too long, or a pedofile if I act too friendly towards kids. While these aren't usually a professional issue they do change the way I act/think and cause me to act differently to my normal-self.</p>

      <p> How could one overcome the feelings of Stereotype threat? Well one way I find quite useful is to try push my self doubt back onto others, the old "walk a mile in a mans shoes" philosophical question. "Do I think that guy is racist for staring at me" etc. it often makes it easier to relax and realise it's mostly in my head rather than a real (stereotype) threat.</p>

      <p> So this is about the total extent of my personal experience with Stereotype Threat, obviously in this line of work there will be a lot of others experiencing this phenomenom as the tech industry in New Zealand has a lot of imported employees. I hope if a future employee/friend has similar thoughts they would be able to tell me and maybe I can tell them how I deal with such thoughts/issues and help them move past it.</p>
      <p> Thanks for reading. Julian. </p>
