    <div id="content"><p>Ruby vs Javascript - Hashes vs Objects</p>
      <p>There are quite a few similarities between Javascript objects and Ruby hashes, afterall everything in ruby as an 'object' so that shouldn't be completely surprising. Firstly they can both be shown in a very similar way, I'll show an example of each breifly.</p>
      <p> Ruby: - is basically a variable that you define within curley brackets that has a key and a value for each entry. e.g. farm_talley = {cows: 14, sheep: 22, chicken: 50}. Through certain lines of code you can access and manipulate these entries.</p>
      <p> Javascript: - can be set up in the same way using the "var" funciton. The other differnece here is that the first item is refered to as a property instead of a key. e.g. var farm_talley = {cows: 14, sheep: 22, chicken: 50}. This looks almost identical to the ruby version, however in Javascript you can set this up another way. eg. var farm = new Object(); Now you simply add new items to this by calling the newly created object name and putting ".property = value". E.g. farm.cows = 14 would enter the first key/value pair from "farm_talley" to farm.</p>
      <p> There are a lot of subtle differences but it is important to know the similarities, it makes switching between programming styles much easier than switching from say Chinese to Arabic.</P>
        <p> I hope you found this information useful and/or informative. Thanks for reading, Julian </p>
