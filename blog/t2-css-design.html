    <div id="content">Classes and Id's are things used to select specific information on a webpage so that you can format it exactly how you like, without changing any/everything else.

    Classes and Id's differ in that classes can be used in muliple places whereas Id's are specifc to one piece of HTML.

    A class is inserted into an HTML file as such 'class=["whateveryouwanthere"]'. You don't include the square brackets. To reference the class in the CSS file you use a fullstop like so '.whateveryouwantthere' 

    Id's are used the same way as classes except that you type 'id' instead of 'class' and '#' instead of '.' in the CSS file.

    It is best practice to use id when there is one instance of an item you are formatting (such as "your name") and best practice to use class is in instances where you will re-use the formatting on multiple lines of code.

    I hope this has been helpful
    Thanks for reading
