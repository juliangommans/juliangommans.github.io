    <div id="content">What is an enumerable and what is a map?

      An Enumerable is something used in coding, in this instance Ruby, is a class of methods that allows you several ways of searching, sorting and modify a body of information.

      Map is an enumerable that allows the user to manipulate each individual elements of an array by putting them into a new array. This allows you to manipulate an array without modifying the original data.

      An example where this might be useful is if you wanted to find out the cube (or any exponent) of a group of numbers.

      For example:
      def exponents(array)
        array.map{|x| x**3}
      end
      
      Now if you call the method "exponents" with any array of numbers in the brackets, eg [1,2,3] you will get the result of all of those numbes cubed eg [1,8,27]

      The "x" in the curly brackets is representing each item in the array and ** is syntax for "exponent".

      Hopefully this has been helpful for you and you can use the map enumerable in the future

      See you next time
