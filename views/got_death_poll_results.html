			<h1>Game of Thrones Death Poll Results</h1>
			<h3>Episode 3 was the big battle, everyone picked who they thought would die, and who would survive.</h3>
			<h4>Revised Rules</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p>In each section a selected character will give X points if they die, or subtract X points if they survive.</p></li>
				<li><p>If they are unconfirmed (looks like they died but it's not certain, i.e. off screen) there will be no gain or loss.</p></li>
				<li><p>If they die, and you left them in the "survive" column, you lose 1 point.</p></li>
				<li><p>If they weren't in the episode and you picked them to die, you don't lose points</p></li>
